## Installation

Installation requires `gstreamer` for your platform.

After you install `gstreamer`, you can compile and install by cloning the repository and running `cargo install --path .`

Alternatively, you can run `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"  cargo install --profile=release-lto --path .` to enable architecture-specific optimizations

## FAQ

- Q: Why the hell would you want this?
  - A: You can use it to quickly preview videos in the terminal. Otherwise, it's mostly just for fun and it looks cool.
- Q: How is it so fast?
  - A: It's mostly `gstreamer` being fast, but also the renderer only renders what changes between frames and optimizes escape sequence output. Also it's fast due to making the buffer on stdout quite massive.
- Q: Why is it being slow?
  - A: Skill issue üöÄÔ∏è. But seriously, if you're having performance issues, use a faster terminal emulator like [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty). That terminal emulator is ridiculously fast and is perfect for `onna`.
- Q: Can it play Bad Apple?
  - A: Yes, and with no dropped frames at a 319x77 terminal resolution with xterm on my machine.
- Q: Can it run DOOM?
  - A: It currently doesn't allow user interaction, so it can't play games, but it can watch DOOM gameplay.
- Q: Where does the name come from?
  - A: `onna` (`Â•≥`) in Japanese translates to `girl`. I named it this after a video I used for testing, [`Â•≥„ÅÆÂ≠ê„Å´„Å™„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ` (I wanna be a girl)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucbx9we6EHk) by `„Åæ„Åµ„Åæ„Åµ` (MafuMafu).
    This was the first video I thought of other than Bad Apple and it proved to be an amazing video for testing because it has lots of changing colors, lots of different edge cases, and because I could actually tolerate watching the video over 20 times in a single day.
- Q: Why does kitty crash when I resize the window after running `onna` in kitty mode.
  - A: This is a [known kitty bug](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/6555) with images. Try building kitty from source. If it still crashes, it's not my fault.
- Q: When's sixel support coming?
  - A: Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
- Q: Why do you need so many questions in an FAQ?
  - A: Because people asked me a bunch of questions. Why else?

  - Added experimental `kitty` mode which uses the kitty image protocol
  - Applied gamma correction in `ascii` mode
  - Dark pixels will no longer occasionally become way too bright for no apparent reason
